#Coin Estimator By Weight
#When some people receive change after shopping, they put it into a container
#and let it add up over time. Once they fill up the container,
#they'll roll them up in coin wrappers which can then be traded in at a bank for what they are worth.

#Allow the user to input the total weight of each type of coin they have (pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters).
#Print out how many of each type of coin wrapper they would need,
#how many coins they have, and the estimated total value of all their money.
#Subgoals:

#Round all numbers printed out to the nearest whole number.
#Allow the user to select whether they want to submit the weight in either grams or pounds.

# Penny = 2.5g | Nickel = 5.0g | Dime = 2.268g | Quarter = 5.67g
